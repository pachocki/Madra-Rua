# Madra Rua
Madra Rua is a website dedicated to Irish Setters and dog breeding. The website provides information on this beautiful breed of dog, including their history, characteristics, and care requirements. Additionally, Madra Rua offers a dog hostel service, where dogs can be taken care of while their owners are away on holiday.

# Technical details
The website is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. These technologies were chosen for their ease of use, flexibility, and wide range of supported features. As the designer, I was responsible for creating the color palette and overall visual design of the website.
